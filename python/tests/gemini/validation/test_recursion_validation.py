"""Recursive Gemini kernels must be rejected, and rejected *fast*.

Before the guard in `logical.kernel`, a cyclic call graph did not raise -- it
sent `AddressAnalysis` into a phi**max_depth traversal that never returned
(bloqade-lanes#921). Some tests here would hang rather than fail if the guard
regressed, which is why they assert on elapsed time as well as on the error.

Note that recursion reaches the guard in two different IR shapes. A kernel
calling itself is lowered as a *dynamic* call on its own `%<name>_self` block
argument, and is only rewritten into a static `func.Invoke` after `run_pass`
returns; a call into an already-built kernel is a static `func.Invoke` straight
away. `CallGraph` has to understand both, so both are covered below.
