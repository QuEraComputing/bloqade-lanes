"""Terminal-measurement validation reports; it does not crash.

Both paths below reach the same place: the measure-id analysis cannot say what
a ``terminal_measure`` produced, so validation should say *that* and move on.
Neither used to. ``ValidationSuite`` wraps a pass that raises in a bare
``except Exception`` and re-reports it as ``Validation pass '...' failed:``
followed by a Python traceback -- which reads as a compiler crash rather than as
"your kernel is not valid", and buries the other violations found alongside it.

The two crashes were:

- ``impl/measure_id.py`` asserted the register type was ``types.Generic``. An
  ordinary untyped parameter makes it ``AnyType``, so an ``AssertionError``
  escaped. The neighbouring guards in that impl already return ``AnyMeasureId``
  for every other unknowable case.
- ``impl/measurement.py`` looked the result up with ``Frame.get``, which raises
  on a missing key instead of returning None. The analysis has no entry when the
  statement sits inside a callee that was not inlined, because it was evaluated
  in a nested frame.

Neither needs `verify=True` to reach, so the fixtures here build with
`verify=False` and drive the suite directly.
