"""Regression tests for #539 — Steane [[7,1,3]] transversal compilation
introduced a spurious logical X-flip when a single qubit accumulated 3+
consecutive ``S → H → CX → H → S†`` patterns.

Root cause was the upstream ``squin.native`` ``SQRT_Y`` / ``SQRT_Y_DAG``
swap (see ``QuEraComputing/bloqade-circuit#751``) that flowed through
the ``squin.rewrite.U3_to_clifford`` decomposition on its way to Stim.
Fixed upstream in ``bloqade-circuit==0.14.1``; ``bloqade-lanes`` picks
it up via the pin bump in #559.

These tests guard against regressions of the user-facing symptom —
both 2-pattern and 3-pattern circuits must agree with their raw
(un-encoded) reference on the post-selected ``P(q[0] = 0)``. The
3-pattern variant is the case that triggered the bug pre-#559.
