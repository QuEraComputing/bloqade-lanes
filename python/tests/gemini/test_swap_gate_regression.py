"""Regression tests for QuEraComputing/bloqade-internal#431.

``squin.swap`` was rejected by the Gemini logical validation even though SWAP is
Clifford and ``SquinToNative`` lowers it to native gates the same way it lowers
``squin.cx``. The validation method table had no impl for ``gate.stmts.Swap``, so
the analysis fell through to ``eval_fallback`` and every logical kernel
containing a swap failed at kernel definition -- long before the lowering that
would have handled it.
