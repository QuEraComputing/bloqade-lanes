"""Reject the experimental extension statements on paths that cannot support them.

The statements in :mod:`bloqade.gemini.logical.dialects.extensions` are part of
the ``@gemini.logical.kernel`` dialect group, so they lower and compile like any
other logical statement. What sets them apart is that they are *not* logical
operations: ``StarRz`` puts physical Z rotations on the three qubits of a
weight-3 logical-Z representative, which takes the state out of the code space.
The state only comes back if the program post-selects on the error-correction
checks around it -- something the compiler neither inserts nor can verify.

That makes them usable, but only deliberately: in simulation, where the user can
post-select on the detectors themselves. This pass is the guard for everywhere
else. It is deliberately **not** part of ``@gemini.logical.kernel``'s own
validation suite -- putting it there would reject the feature at definition
time, everywhere, which is the opposite of what a gated experimental feature
needs. It is added to the suites that submit a program for execution instead,
and adding it to a suite is what turns the guard on.

**The whole call graph is searched**, not just the validated kernel's own body.
A Gemini kernel is aggressively unrolled, so in practice a use inside a helper
has already been inlined into its caller by the time any suite runs -- but a
guard is the wrong place to bank on that. Nothing stops a method reaching a
device undecorated (the CUDA-Q route builds one by conversion), or reaching one
with inlining turned off, and a guard that assumes a compilation shape fails
open exactly when the assumption breaks.

The traversal is kirin's abstract interpreter, the same mechanism
``GeminiTerminalMeasurementValidation`` next door uses: ``impls.Func`` gives this
analysis a ``func.Invoke`` impl, so descending into a statically resolved callee
is the interpreter's own behaviour rather than something this pass arranges. It
inherits that machinery's one limitation -- a callee reached only through a
dynamic ``func.Call`` is not descended into, see :meth:`run_lattice` -- which is
the same line every other Forward analysis in this package draws.

**The check is on the dialect**, not on a list of statement types, so a second
extension is covered the day it is added rather than the day someone remembers
to update this file. That is why it lives in :meth:`eval_fallback` rather than
in a method table: an impl has to name a statement class, and nothing here wants
to know which statements exist -- only which dialect they came from.

One error per offending statement, so a program with three uses reports all
three -- the same report-everything contract the validations next door keep.

Each error is anchored to the statement. The user-facing wrappers are ``@kernel``
stdlib kernels, so the location generally points inside
``bloqade.gemini.logical.extensions`` rather than at the user's call site,
whether or not inlining has run. The message names the statement for that
reason, rather than relying on the caret.
