"""Shared geometry primitives for architecture construction.

This module holds the parts of zone construction that are *geometry*
rather than *building*: unit conversion, AOD transport path search, and
blockade-pair derivation.  It is deliberately free of builder state — every
entry point takes a :class:`ZoneGeometry` value and returns a result — so
that both the legacy ``ZoneBuilder`` and the redesigned builder in
:mod:`bloqade.lanes.arch.build.v2` can share one implementation.

All internal geometry is stored as nm-integer values so that set
membership, tuple equality, and candidate hashing are exact.  User-facing
APIs accept and return µm floats; conversion happens at the boundary.
