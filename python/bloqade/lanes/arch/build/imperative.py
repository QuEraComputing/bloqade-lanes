    more than once; taking the first arrival is what makes its place in the
    result well defined.

    Ordering by traversal rather than by word ID matters whenever word IDs
    are not monotone in the grid, which is the normal case for interleaved
    CZ layouts: scanning x visits words 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., so a
    partial x-selection reaches them out of ID order.  An AOD transport is
    separable and order-preserving — each x-tone and y-tone sweeps
    independently and tones cannot cross — so it maps the source tones onto
    the destination tones in the same order.  Selecting both endpoints the
    same way therefore pairs ``src[i]`` with ``dst[i]`` correctly, including
    for a compression or expansion, where the displacement differs per
    column and no single translation describes the bus.
