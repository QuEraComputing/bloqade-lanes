"""AOD realizability rules for architecture buses.

An AOD is a crossed pair of deflectors: its traps sit at the Cartesian
product of the x-tones and y-tones, and each tone is swept independently.
A transport is realizable exactly when it is **separable and
order-preserving**:

* every atom's x-displacement depends only on which column it is in, and
  its y-displacement only on its row — an atom cannot leave its own tone;
* tones keep their relative order, since two frequencies cannot pass
  through each other.

This is weaker than a uniform translation: compressing or expanding a
rectangle gives each column a different displacement and is still one AOD
operation.  The path search in :mod:`.._geometry` is the stricter party —
it derives one reference path and applies its deltas to every lane — so a
legal non-uniform bus is accepted here and simply lands unrouted.
