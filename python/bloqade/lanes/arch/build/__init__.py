"""Architecture construction tooling.

Public API for building ``ArchSpec`` instances. Two layers:

- :mod:`.imperative` — low-level ``ZoneBuilder`` / ``ArchBuilder`` for
  hand-crafted zones.
- :mod:`.blueprint` — high-level ``build_arch(blueprint)`` entry point
  that consumes a declarative ``ArchBlueprint`` (zones + ``DeviceLayout``)
  and emits a validated ``ArchSpec``.

Plus :mod:`.topology` (connectivity protocol implementations) and
:mod:`.word_factory` (``WordGrid`` helper used during zone assembly).
