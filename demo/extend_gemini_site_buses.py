# # Extending the site buses of the Gemini physical architecture
#
# Given an architecture, add buses to it — without disturbing what is
# already there.
#
# The Gemini physical spec ships with three site buses, the three
# dimensions of a hypercube over a word's eight sites. That is enough to
# get an atom from any site to any other, but a move between distant sites
# takes several hops. Here we add a fourth bus that does site 0 → site 7
# in one move, and check that nothing else about the architecture changed.
#
# The thing to watch is the transport paths. The bundled spec's lane
# geometry is *calibrated hardware data* — it came from the machine, not
# from the builder's path search, which cannot reproduce it. Extending the
# architecture must leave every one of those paths byte-for-byte intact and
# route only the bus we just added.

# ## Restore the spec into a builder
#
# `from_spec` rebuilds the whole architecture — the shared word template,
# the zone's coordinates, its buses and its participation sets. Clearances
# are the one thing an `ArchSpec` does not carry: they are inputs to the
# path search rather than properties of the machine, so we supply them
# here. They are used *only* to route buses we add; everything already in
# the spec keeps the paths it arrived with.

# ## Add the long-range site bus
#
# Site 0 and site 7 sit at opposite ends of the word. Reaching one from the
# other over the hypercube takes three moves (0 → 1 → 3 → 7); one direct
# bus does it in a single AOD sweep.
#
# The builder checks the move is something an AOD can actually perform
# before accepting it: every atom's displacement must depend only on its
# row and column, and tones may not cross.

# ## The calibrated paths are untouched
#
# Every lane that existed before must come back identical. This is the
# property the whole exercise turns on: lane durations are measured off
# these segment lengths, so re-routing them as a side effect of adding a
# bus would quietly change fidelity estimates for the entire machine.

# surfacing later as a warning or a silently wrong spec.

# %%
# 1. A bus that repeats an existing one. A bus's index is its bus_id and
#    preserved paths key off it, so a duplicate only adds redundant lanes.
try:
    builder.add_site_bus(zone.name, src=[0], dst=[7])
except ValueError as error:
    print(f"duplicate rejected: {error}")

# 2. A move no AOD can perform. Reversing the order of the sites would
#    require two tones to pass through each other.
try:
    builder.add_site_bus(zone.name, src=[0, 1, 2, 3], dst=[7, 6, 5, 4])
except ValueError as error:
    print(f"\nunperformable rejected: {error}")

# 3. Adding a bus with no clearances to route it. Without them the search
#    cannot run, and the builder says so rather than guessing.
try:
    no_clearances = ArchBuilder.from_spec(spec)
    no_clearances.add_site_bus(zone.name, src=[0], dst=[7])

# ## Rebuilding without extending changes nothing at all
#
# A plain round-trip is lossless, paths included — worth knowing if you
# want to inspect an architecture through the builder without altering it.
